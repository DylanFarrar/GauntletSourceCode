# Gauntlet
### My First Completed Game
### Description:
#### I made a Gauntlet style first-person shooter which times the player as they go through a level destroying each enemy player on their way to the end of the level as fast as they can. For every enemy the player fails to destroy 3 seconds will be added to the final time. The game will keep track of your best time you get while playing the game as well as remember your personal sensitivity setting from the main menu.
### How to Play:
#### How the Game Works:
##### The objective of the game is to go through the level as fast as possible while destroying every enemy in the level. All enemies missed will add 3 seconds to your final time.
### Controls:
##### The game uses classic FPS controls for the player movement WASD to move around, space to jump, left click to fire your weapon, you move your mouse to look around, and you can use escape to both go to menu and close the game if you're already in a menu. The only other control is when you press Q you will use a dash that applies forward and slightly upward momentum to the player in the direction they're looking when they activiate the Q allowing them to try to move through the level faster while simultaneously destroying enemies on the way through the level.
#### Self Made Assets
##### All 3D models besides the standard unity geometry are made by myself in blender and exported into the project.
